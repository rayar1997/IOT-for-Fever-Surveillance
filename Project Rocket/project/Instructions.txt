CODES :
	(i) client.py [Sends the image to a server that is hosted next]
	(ii) main.py  [Gets the image sent to the server by the client]
       (iii) view.py  [Hosts the server to allow image transfers]
	(iv) depth_face_detect.py 
		[Experimental code : Finds the distance of a detected face on the rgb camera and 
			             also gets the temperature from lepton]
	(v) Lepton Folder (not added due to size constraints but added files individually) has the Lepton3 library that is used to capture the thermal image and 		compute temperature.
	(vi) Haar cascade frontal face default xml file in data that contains the pre trained face detection model.
Execution : 
	(i) Run client.py first to allow it to send the computed image with all detections done and ready to be hosted.
	(ii) Run main.py to get the image sent to the server by the client. 
	(iii) Run view.py which is the server that is hosted to allow the image to be transferred to view on a website.
	

	Once the above is done,
		Hit the address with a webserver hosted locally at 127.0.0.1:5002 
		You will see the ADMIN INTERFACE with the video streamed with the detected faces and temperatures.
